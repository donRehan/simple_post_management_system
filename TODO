1.  Create a post List Component:

[x]    Create a component that displays a list of posts.

3. Implement Routing:

    Set up Angular routing to navigate between the post List andpost Details
    Define routes for each component and configure them in the app-routing.module.ts file.
    Use Angular's routerLink directive to navigate between components.

2.  Create a Post Detail Component:

    Create a component that displays the details of a selected post.
    When a user is clicked from the Post List, navigate to the Post Detail component.
    Fetch the detailed post data based on the selected post's ID from the API.
    Display the post's detailed information such as Name, Email, Address, etc.

4.  Add Error Handling and Validation:
