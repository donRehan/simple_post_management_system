    Fetch the detailed post data based on the selected post's ID from the API.
    Display the post's detailed information such as Name, Email, Address, etc.

3. Implement Routing:

    Set up Angular routing to navigate between the post List andpost Details
    Define routes for each component and configure them in the app-routing.module.ts file.
    Use Angular's routerLink directive to navigate between components.

4.  Add Error Handling and Validation:

    Implement error handling for API requests and display appropriate error messages.
