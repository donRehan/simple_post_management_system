Task: Create a Post Management System

1.  Create a post List Component:

[x]    Create a component that displays a list of posts.
[x]    Create a service to take the requests and then have post-list as a
       separate component (my thought)
[x]    Fetch the list of users from an API using Angular's HttpClient module.
[x]    Display the user data in a table with columns such as ID, Name, Email, etc.
[x]    Add pagination functionality to display a limited number of posts per page.

2.  Create a Post Detail Component:

[x] Create a component that displays the details of a selected post.
[x] When a user is clicked from the Post List, navigate to the Post Detail component.
[x] Fetch the detailed post data based on the selected post's ID from the API.
[x] Display the post's detailed information such as Name, Email, Address, etc.


3. Implement Routing:

[x] Set up Angular routing to navigate between the post List andpost Details
    Define routes for each component and configure them in the app-routing.module.ts file.
    Use Angular's routerLink directive to navigate between components.

4.  Add Error Handling and Validation:

    Implement error handling for API requests and display appropriate error messages.
    Validate the input fields in the User Edit component and display validation errors if required.
